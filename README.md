# ACFinder
Opposite of ACHelper.  
It finds when someone may be using an autoclicker based on their clicks in the window.  

## Info ##
I remember making this over a year ago because someone called me out for being a cheater simply because I had made my other repository "ACHelper", for whatever reason I decided to rush together this and quite honestly it works but it works horribly. I coded it like some sort of Minecraft anticheat and quite honestly I'm pretty sure I added/modified code so that I could still make an **CRINGE** autoclicker that would bypass this.

Minecraft cheating, lmao
